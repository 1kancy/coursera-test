                <h2>Love the Person</h2>
                <p>If the only thing you like about someone is the attention they give you,
                     the gifts they lavish upon you,
                      or the pleasure they cause you to experience,
                       then it is not love you feel.
                </p>

                <h2>Love is Binary</h2>
                <p>This is not a commentary on post-modern gender expression. In fact,
                     it goes beyond it. To me, True Love is a “yes” or “no” concept and is separate from sexual and/or romantic concerns. 
                     The love I feel for a friend (regardless of sex/gender) is the same I feel for my parents. 
                    It’s simply just love.

                <h2>Love is reciprocated</h2>
                <p>
                    Love is only Love when it is reciprocated.
                    I’ve harped on this many times before, but I’ll do it one more time. Love must be reciprocated if it is to be True Love. If an person loves someone who does not return that love, that respect and willingness to sacrifice for no reason other than they need me to, then it isn’t love.


                    It’s obsession. </p>
